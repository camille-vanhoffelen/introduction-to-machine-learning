It would be really helpful however to keep track of the validation loss & accuracy throughout the epochs.

    "\n",
    "Today, we learned about **evaluation methods**. First, we noted that training loss makes for a bad model quality metric, since it cannot detect **overfitting**. We introduced the idea of a held-out **test set** to better estimate generalization properties on unseen examples. We highlighted how test sets work if they are of the **same distribution** as the data we will encounter at prediction time, and if they are **large enough**. We then described how an independent test set can still be prone to overfitting if used as part of **model development**. Since machine learning development is **experimental** & **iterative** in nature, the data scientist introduces an **information leak** between the test set and the model hyperparameters. We introduced the **validation set** as a solution. We split the responsibilities of **comparing** models, and **assessing** models, which allows engineers to both develop and measure the quality machine learning solutions. We then showed that losses weren't always interpretable values, and introducted new **metrics**, like classification accuracy or regression MSE. We underlined the importance of choosing a **single number metric** to define model quality, and speed up model development. We then synthesized all these new workflows into a **ML development checklist**, which captures the steps of typical ML engineering experiments. Finally, we applied this checklist to three ML frameworks: sklearn, keras, and pytorch. In doing so, we built viable ML solutions from scratch for banknote authentication and emoji classification tasks.\n",

    "Today, we discovered a new deep learning library, **pytorch**. We first explained how **GPUs** can accelerate neural networks with parallel matrix operations, and large memory bandwitdth. Computing time is a bottleneck in neural network optimization, so **faster** training leads to **more powerful** models. We listed tensorflow & pytorch as the most popular DL frameworks which can interface with GPUs. We then learned how to use pytorch: first by creating **`Tensor`s**, then by backpropagating through a computation graph with the **`autograd`** package. We applied this to neural networks by extending the **`nn.Module`**, where we defined **layers** and the **`.forward()`** method. We **looped** this code by iterating through a **`DataLoader`** , and recreated the banknote authentication classifier from last lecture. Finally, we ported the pytorch neural network to **Google colab** , and trained it on a **GPU runtime environment**.\n",

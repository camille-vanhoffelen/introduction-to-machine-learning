    "Today, we learned about **Convolutional Neural Networks**. We defined **computer vision** as the field specializing in image data analysis. We pointed out a few standout quirks of image data: **high dimensionality**, **translational invariance**, and **local redundancy**. We discovered **convolutional neural layers**, and showed how they leverage translational invariance to **share model parameters** across sliding input windows. This helps with the **computational complexity** of modeling so many feature dimensions. We then highlighted how **pooling layers** further improve network efficiency in the deeper layers by **downsampling** activation tensors, and discarding **locally redundant** information. When stacked with **fully connected layers**, these form **convolutional neural networks**. We listed some CNN **design conventions** , but noted that these architecture choices are **complex**. Finally, we helped the Unicode Consortium by implementing and training our own CNN **image classifier** in pytorch, to identify `face`, `flag`, and `animal` emojis.\n",

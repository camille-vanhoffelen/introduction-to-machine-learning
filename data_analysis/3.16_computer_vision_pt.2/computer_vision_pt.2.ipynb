Summary\n","\n","Today we learned about **modern computer vision models** and **transfer learning**. We first revisited the **history of CNNs** to understand the improvements that led to the current state of the art. We pointed out a trend of **wider**, **deeper** models, and **larger** datasets, and noted that restricts most data scientists from training modern CV models from scratch. We explored the **hidden representations** of deep CNNs and understood the relationship between the **depth**, **specifity**, and **power** of the layers. After noting that large CNNs learned **similar** low-level features for each training, we defined **transfer learning** as techniques that **share** this information between models for similar tasks. We described two methods: **feature extraction** and **fine-tuning**, and showed how they can help create accurate CV models with **smaller datasets** and **less hardware**. We highlighted how this played into the unique machine learning **open-source** ecosystem, which democratises knowledge and tools to build cutting edge A.I systems. We reviewed a few pro-tips for CV, and explained how **data augmentation** can help further squeeze learnable information out of a dataset. Finally, we applied transfer learning to computer vision by fine-tuning a **ResNet-18** model pre-trained on ImageNet, to a waffle or ice cream image classification problem.\n","\n","# Resources\n","\n","## Core Resources\n","\n","- [Transfer learning tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/transfer_learning_tutorial.html)  \n","Official pytorch tutorial that this notebook was based on\n","- [cs231n - transfer learning](https://cs231n.github.io/transfer-learning/)  \n","Succint and practical notes on transfer learning from Karpathy's classic computer vision course\n","- [torchvision](https://github.com/pytorch/vision)  \n","torchvision github repository\n","- [Waffle or ice cream dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sapal6/waffles-or-icecream)  \n","Kaggle dataset used to make this notebook\n","\n","### Additional Resources\n","\n","- [Towards reprodubility with pytorch hub](https://pytorch.org/blog/towards-reproducible-research-with-pytorch-hub/)  \n","Pytorch hub introduction\n","- [Finetuning torchvision models](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/finetuning_torchvision_models_tutorial.html)  \n","More in depth official pytorch tutorial showing how to fine-tune _all_ torchvision pre-trained models\n","- [CNN architectures](https://towardsdatascience.com/neural-network-architectures-156e5bad51ba)  \n","Breakdown of major CNN architectures.\n","- [Illustrated 10 CNN architectures](https://towardsdatascience.com/illustrated-10-cnn-architectures-95d78ace614d)  \n","Illustrated breakdown of CNN architectures\n","- [Feature visualization in NNs](https://distill.pub/2017/feature-visualization/)  \n","Article visually representing the hidden representations of GoogLeNet\n","- [albumentations](https://github.com/albumentations-team/albumentations)  \n","Image augmentation library, part of the pytorch ecosystem\n","- [The data that changed the world](https://qz.com/1034972/the-data-that-changed-the-direction-of-ai-research-and-possibly-the-world/)  \n","Quartz article about the disruptive effect of ImageNet on CV and A.I\n","- [Why does batch normalization work](https://youtu.be/nUUqwaxLnWs)  \n","Deeplearning.ai video providing intuition on why batch normalization works\n","- [ResNets](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/convolutional-neural-networks/resnets-HAhz9)  \n","deeplearning.ai lecture on ResNets and skip connections\n","- [Understanding dropout](https://youtu.be/ARq74QuavAo)  \n","deeplearning.ai video provising intuition on why dropout works "]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"XLZ5qYOpUDhc","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":[""],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]}]}

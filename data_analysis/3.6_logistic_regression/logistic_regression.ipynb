    "\n",
    "Today, we learned about our first classification method, **logistic regression**. We restated that classification tasks aim to predict **categorical** labels, and visualized this for one feature in a two dimensional plot. Linear models were a bad fit binary labels, so we discovered the **logistic function** that could predict **probabilities** between 0 & 1. We described how **thresholds** can turn these probabilities into a binary prediction. The logistic function can be **parameterized** by feeding a **linear model** as its argument, like a set of russian dolls. This means that we can **optimize** our logistic model using the **cross-entropy** cost function and **gradient descent**. We explained what **decision boundaries** are, and how important they are for **classifiers**. We also extended our logistic regression to the **multi-class** setting, where it could predict **multiple labels** with a **softmax** hypothesis. Finally, we put this knowledge to practice by predicting if wines were **tasty**, and visualizing the **decision boundary** of our trained **logistic regression** model.\n",

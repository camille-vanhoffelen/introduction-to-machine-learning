He's confident about the fact that a pokemon with higher `Total` stat is better, but he's not sure what that means for an entire `Type 1`. The highest average `Total`? The max value? Since this is broad question, it requires a broad answer: we decide to provide him with _insights_ into the \"goodness\" of pokemon types.\n",

Then we add a `subplot` to this canvas. The method returns an [`axes`](https://matplotlib.org/api/axes_api.html) object which is the key to all of matplotlib's methods and functionality. For example, it allows us to then directly call the [`.hist()`](https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.axes.Axes.hist.html#matplotlib.axes.Axes.hist) method to plot our `Water` types distribution:"

    "Today was our introduction to **data visualization**. We learned the difference between **data literacy** and **visual literacy**, and why those are so important to data science. We learned tricks and good practices to improve our **data story-telling**. For example, we now know that **minimalism** in graph design makes for clear and concise plots. We also saw how **colors**, **text**, and **conventions** all matter to convey information effectively. We identified how visualization can be used for both data **exploration** and **communication**, and highlighted the workflow differences between the two. Finally, we revisited our pokemon trainer ambitions and compared distributions with customized **violin plots** in **matplotlib**.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start doing fancy things with python üêç, we've got to install in a way that's easy to use and configure. This [blog post](https://hackernoon.com/reaching-python-development-nirvana-bb5692adf30c) has saved me many hours and headaches over the years, so we are going to follow it to install your interpreter and package manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Windows Subsystem for Linux\n",
    "\n",
    "_This is for windows users, if you use macOS please skip to [pyenv](#1.2-Pyenv)._\n",
    "\n",
    "macOS was gifted terminal, windows is stuck with powershell. Let's fix that using the [windows subsystem for linux](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WSL), which allows you to run an ubuntu terminal on your windows machine. This means you'll be able to execute Linux binaries and use unix package managers such as [apt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APT_(software)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Please follow the steps in this [guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Pyenv\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's install [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) so that we don't later get confused by 769876234 different python interpreter versions installed on your machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Windows\n",
    "Copy paste each line one by one, and run them in your ubuntu shell:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash \n",

    "If you are on a redhat GNU linux based system, please follow this [blog post](https://medium.com/@joepreludian/starting-your-python-dev-environment-with-pyenv-and-pipenv-on-a-redhat-gnu-linux-based-system-d66795377ea). Thanks Bashar for the link!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Checking Install\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check if the installation was successful by running:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "pyenv --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "‚òëÔ∏è It should return something like `pyenv 1.2.17`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Python Interpreter\n",
    "\n",
    "#### global\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you've got `pyenv`, you can use it to install a fresh python interpreter. \n",
    "\n",
    "Run the following in your Ubuntu or Terminal shell to install python 3.8.2:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "pyenv install 3.8.2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You have to set our machine's global python version to 3.8.2 too:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "pyenv global 3.8.2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's check if that worked:\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "python --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "‚òëÔ∏è The last command should return `Python 3.8.2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "üí™ Try to install python 3.7.7, switch your global version to 3.7.7, and check that it worked using `python --version`. Don't forget to switch back to 3.8.2 afterwards!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### local\n",
    "\n",
    "`pyenv` also allows to set _local_ python interpreter. This can be very useful when running old python 2 applications! Let's try it out. First, go to your home directory (or another if you prefer). \n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "# macOS users\n",
    "cd /home/<YOUR_USER_NAME>\n",
    "# windows users\n",
    "cd /mnt/c/Users/<YOUR_USER_NAME>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ÑπÔ∏è [`cd`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cd_(command)) stands for _change directory_, and is your bread and butter of moving around a file system using the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's create a new directory. Use the [`mkdir`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mkdir) command to do so:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "# iml is faster to type than introduction_to_machine_learning...\n",
    "mkdir iml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You also have to change to that newly created directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "cd iml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you can try to set a local python interpreter version by running:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "pyenv local 3.7.7\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "üí™ Try to check if it worked on your own. You can go back to the parent (home) directory using `cd ..`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we don't particularly want to use an older python interpreter for our `iml` directory, make sure to remove the local version:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "cd iml\n",
    "pyenv local --unset\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ÑπÔ∏è Like most other commands and applications, you can find a lot more information about `pyenv` and its usage on its [github](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/blob/master/COMMANDS.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 Pipenv\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can install [pipenv](https://pipenv-fork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) our package & vitual environment manager. Run the following in your shell:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "pip install -U pipenv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This installs `pipenv` for your current python interpreter (which in this case should be your global python interpreter üôÇ).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's check if that worked:\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "pipenv --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "‚òëÔ∏è This should return something like `pipenv, version 2018.11.26`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.5 Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's install some packages! One of the best things about python is how many are available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "üí™ Go to your `iml` directory, make a new directory called `test`, and change to that new directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you are going to two things:\n",
    "* create a [virtual environment](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/)\n",
    "* import the [emoji](https://pypi.org/project/emoji/) package in this environment\n",
    "\n",
    "And you can do it in one command! Run:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "pipenv install emoji\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's check if this worked by reading the [Pipfile](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46330327/how-are-pipfile-and-pipfile-lock-used):\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "open Pipfile\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "‚òëÔ∏è In your text editor, you should see a line with `emoji = \"*\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ÑπÔ∏è There's a lot you can do with `pipenv`, check out the [documentation](https://pipenv-fork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basics.html) if you want to know more.\n",

    "üß† Can you explain why python virtual environments are useful to programmers? Please ask me if this feels unclear\n",

    "Let's put this new python setup to good use with some coding. IPython is the go-to interactive shell for python, and perfect for some quick testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "üí™ Based on your knowledge of [package installation](#1.5-Packages), install [ipython](https://pypi.org/project/ipython/)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then run it with:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "# enter the local virtual environment shell\n",
    "pipenv shell\n",
    "ipython\n",

    "``` python\n",
    "a = 'Machine Learning is fun'\n",

    "You can then print that variable simply by typing:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "a\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ÑπÔ∏è There's too many neat ipython tricks to cover in this class, but for those of you who are curious, the [official documentation](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/index.html) is a good place to start.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's import some packages. Some come automatically installed with your python interpreter (try `import this` or `import antigravity`). Some you have to install through `pipenv`, like we have done before for `emoji`. This means we can now import and use that package! Try the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "import emoji\n",
    "emoji.emojize('Machine Learning is fun :robot_face:')\n",
    "```\n",

    "üí™ Try using the `emoji` package to add other emojis to your python output. (pro-tip, the `:...:` codes are the same as slack)\n",
    "\n",
    "üß† Can you describe the commands and processes that allowed you to use the `emoji` package? Please ask me if this feels unclear\n",
